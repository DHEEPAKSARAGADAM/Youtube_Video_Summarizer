You can test the API by making POST requests to /summarize/ with a JSON payload containing the YouTube video URL and, optionally, keywords for summarization. The API will respond with the summary text.
This structure provides you with a FastAPI application that tokenizes and preprocesses text, summarizes it, and allows you to provide keywords for summarization.
